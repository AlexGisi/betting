A data analysis project evaluating the effectiveness of the GoalImpact metric as an indicator for placing bets on soccer games.

[GoalImpact](http://www.goalimpact.com/) is a metric that rates players based what happens when they're on the field, i.e. the net goals that take place while they play. GoalImpact is not directly public, but tweets are posted suggesting probabilities for games based on the teams' collective GoalImpacts. 

While it's not clear how these probabilities are reached, this project seeks to understand whether they, or a form thereof, can provide a reliable indicator in placing bets. To do so, GoalImpact predictions are paired with game results provided by http://www.football-data.co.uk/.
