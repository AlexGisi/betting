A data analysis project evaluating the effectiveness of the GoalImpact metric as an indicator for predicting the results
of professional soccer games.

[GoalImpact](http://www.goalimpact.com/) is a metric that rates players based what happens when they're on the field, 
i.e. the net goals that take place while they play. Specific match probabilities are provided by @GoalimpactOdds on
Twitter.

This project seeks to provide a platform to evaluate whether these probabilities can provide a reliable indicator to
predict games. GoalImpact predictions are paired with game results provided by http://www.football-data.co.uk/.
